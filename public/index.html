				<h1 class="header">Learn how to track your emotional state</h1>
				<p class="info-sect">Welcome to Flow-State! Here we are trying to understand and track our emotional and mental state to try and better learn when to code through the frutstration or exhaustion, because a flow-state might be around the corner, or to stop and take a break because we are becomming less efficient. This idea was introduced to try and better understand our production patterns. If we can see a trend on when you accomplished more then we may be able to better understand what is causing you to flow in(or out) of the flow state.</p>

				<h2 class="header">Please read carefully how this works</h2>
				<p class="info-sect">When you go to the next page and upload a picture or video of yourself understand that the info used is sent to a third party API. That third party is <span id="kairos-link"><a href="#">Kairos</a></span>. That info is in no way stored on this website unless you <span id="login"><a href="#">login</a></span>. Logging into your account stores the data retrieved from the API and not the actual picture or video uploaded. In no way are we trying to collect data to sell to another company or use for a study. This is simply to track your mood and productivity to try and better produce code when the "time is right".</p>

				<h3 class="header" align="center">Let's look at a good example</h3>
				<p class="info-sect">Here we have a picture that is the prime example of what we need to accurately analyze. Some things such as bad lighting, or angling the face, can throw this off. Best practices would indicate taking the picture in the same place every time with good lighting to get the best results.</p>
